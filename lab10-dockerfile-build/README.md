# lab10-dockerfile-build

Lab 1 - Building applications from Dockerfile

## Files

All files required for this lab are stored directly in this directory or in /vagrant/lab10-dockerfile-build directory of your vagrant machine

## Preparation

It is assumed that all activities will be performed inside /vagrant/lab10-dockerfile-build on your vagrant machine

- Run the following command to change current directory

```
cd /vagrant/lab10-dockerfile-build
```

- Create a new project named "lab10"

```
oc new-project lab10
```

## Building a python application from Dockerfile

- Check an example application at https://github.com/li9com/tornadoapp

- Build the application with custom name

```
[vagrant@openshift ~]$ oc new-app --name demo --strategy docker https://github.com/li9com/tornadoapp
--> Found image f00aae8 (46 hours old) in image stream "openshift/python" under tag "3.6" for "python"

    Python 3.6
    ----------
    Python 3.6 available as container is a base platform for building and running various Python 3.6 applications and frameworks. Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

    Tags: builder, python, python36, rh-python36

    * A Docker build using source code from https://github.com/li9com/tornadoapp will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "demo:latest"
      * Use 'start-build' to trigger a new build
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "demo"
    * Port 8888/tcp will be load balanced by service "demo"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "demo"

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "demo" created
    buildconfig.build.openshift.io "demo" created
    deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "demo" created
    service "demo" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/demo' to track its progress.
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose svc/demo'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
```

- Make sure that pod status is changed and application is built

```
[vagrant@openshift ~]$ oc get pod
NAME           READY     STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
demo-1-build   0/1       Init:0/2   0          3s

demo-1-build   1/1       Running   0          11s
```

- Check the build log

```
[vagrant@openshift ~]$ oc logs -f bc/demo
