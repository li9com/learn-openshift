Lab 12 - Managing roles

## Roles and Cluster Roles

OpenShift has roles of two types:

* __Cluster Roles__ are the roles which available everywhere and can give access on both _cluster-wide_ and _project-wide_ levels.
* __Roles__ are the roles which were created for a project and therefore can work only on the resources within the project.


## Cluster Roles

Cluster roles can be created, modified, updated, deleted by the cluster-admins. OpenShift is supplied with a set of predefined cluster roles. A set of cluster roles can vary from cluster to cluster depending on a number of installed components.

### Discovering exising Cluster Roles

- We can get a list of existing cluster roles

```
$ oc get clusterroles.rbac

Some of interesting cluster roles:
- __cluster-admin__ - use this role to give a full access to the cluster
- __cluster-reader__ - gives read-only access to most of resources of the cluster
- __admin__ - is assigned to admins of projects, projects' owners have it by default
- __edit__ - gives permissions to manipulate resources within a project except the project itself

### Researching a role


- Role __cluster-admin__ has all permissions on all resources enabled

```
$ oc describe clusterrole.rbac cluster-admin
Name:         cluster-admin
Labels:       kubernetes.io/bootstrapping=rbac-defaults
Annotations:  authorization.openshift.io/system-only=true
              openshift.io/description=A super-user that can perform any action in the cluster. When granted to a user within a project, they have full control over quota and membership and can perform every action...
              rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate=true
PolicyRule:
  Resources  Non-Resource URLs  Resource Names  Verbs
  ---------  -----------------  --------------  -----
  *.*        []                 []              [*]
             [*]                []              [*]
```


- Role __edit__ has enabled only specific actions on the certain resources

```
$ oc describe clusterrole.rbac edit
Name:         edit
Labels:       kubernetes.io/bootstrapping=rbac-defaults
Annotations:  openshift.io/description=A user that can create and edit most objects in a project, but can not update the project's membership.

Observe on your own roles __admin__ and __view__.


## Using Roles to give permissions


One of regular tasks while working with projects is to add new members to a project.

- Authenticate using your login

```
$ oc login -u demo
$ oc whoami
demo
```

- Create a project

```
$ oc new-project sharedproject
```

- Check what permissions you have in the project

```
$ oc get rolebindings -n sharedproject
NAME                    ROLE                    USERS     GROUPS                                 SERVICE ACCOUNTS   SUBJECTS
admin                   /admin                  demo
system:deployers        /system:deployer                                                         deployer
system:image-builders   /system:image-builder                                                    builder
system:image-pullers    /system:image-puller              system:serviceaccounts:sharedproject
```

It shows roles __/admin__ assigned to user __demo__.

- Add cluster role __edit__ to the user __user1__

```
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user edit user1 -n sharedproject
role "edit" added: "user1"

$ oc get rolebindings
NAME                    ROLE                    USERS     GROUPS                                 SERVICE ACCOUNTS   SUBJECTS
admin                   /admin                  demo
edit                    /edit                   user1
system:deployers        /system:deployer                                                         deployer
system:image-builders   /system:image-builder                                                    builder
system:image-pullers    /system:image-puller              system:serviceaccounts:sharedproject
```

Now log in to the cluster as user __user1__ and check that you can see and use project __sharedproject__

```
$ oc login -u user1
$ oc get projects
$ oc project sharedproject
```

and log in to the cluster back as __demo__ (or whichever your one is) user

```
$ oc login -u demo
```

- Remove role __edit__ from user __user1__

```
$ oc adm policy remove-role-from-user edit user1 -n sharedproject
role "edit" removed: "user1"
$ oc get rolebindings
NAME                    ROLE                    USERS     GROUPS                                 SERVICE ACCOUNTS   SUBJECTS
admin                   /admin                  demo
system:deployers        /system:deployer                                                         deployer
system:image-builders   /system:image-builder                                                    builder
system:image-pullers    /system:image-puller              system:serviceaccounts:sharedproject
```
Now user __user1__ is not here.

- Log in as user __user1__ to the cluster and check the access to project __sharedproject__

```
$ oc login -u user1
```

Supposing that __user1__ did not have other projects before __sharedproject__ the output will be like this
 
```
$ oc get projects
NAME      DISPLAY NAME   STATUS
```

Try to get in to the project __sharedproject__

```
$ oc project sharedproject
error: You are not a member of project "sharedproject".
To see projects on another server, pass '--server=<server>'.
```
